# NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)
Natural language processing (NLP) can be a field of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence involving human-language interactions; especially the way of programming computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. Today, the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly helps businesses solve many difficult problems. Natural language processing (NLP) is a subset of AI used to analyze text to understand the meaning of human natural language. This is one of the best widely used solution to solve the customer behavior and sentiment analysis problems based on a big unstructured data.
Natural language processing is paramount in Computer Science. It has a multitude of useful applications in life as well as research. We can consider some applications of natural language processing such as:
o Voice recognition
o Speech synthesis
o Machine translation
o Retrieve information.
o Document classification
o Data mining and knowledge discovery
o Sentiment analysis


# What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis is the process of using algorithms to analyze positive or negative thoughts, beliefs, feelings, opinions, or trends expressed in human natural language. Emotional analysis is used in many industries to help harness customers' knowledge, emotions, and perspectives. Exploiting customers' emotions plays an important role in making decisions, making the right business strategy. For example, machine learning combined with artificial intelligence to analyze content in emails, messages, comments on social networks, etc. Accordingly, the business can etermine the customer emotion. Track complaints about specific issues and better manage the customer journey experience.
Sentiment analysis is supported by NLP natural language processing technology and machine learning algorithm. Help computer systems and programs learn from big data and make
predictions about emotion.
