Natural Language Processing
Abstract: The goal of this study is to apply the supervised machines learning and deep learning methods to mining customer reviews in short-term rental services. First, the raw data in human natural language is extracted from the website “http://insideairbnb.com/”. These raw data will be preprocessed using text processing techniques such as text normalization, tokenization, remove stop-words, stemming, lemmatization. Then, the cleaned data is applied features engineering methods like Bad of words, TF-IDF (Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency), Word2vec to extract the outstanding features for classifier model training. Machine learning and Deep learning models are built to categorize user feedback as positive, negative, and neutral; and to summarize the key words from reviews to help the manager easily and quickly understand their business issues.

CASE STUDY INTRODUCTION:
In the recent decade, homestay is a form of short-term rental business that has been strongly developed around the world. Anyone can easily run a small business with their own apartments or houses. Airbnb (Airbed and Breakfast) appeared in 2008 by two design students in San Francisco that helped connect tenants and renters around the world through a mobile app. All reservations, payments, and feedback are done through the “Airbnb” application. In addition, this application assists to collect the customers’ reviews and feedback about their experience after staying. Besides, almost new customers look at the reviews to find out a good and suitable accommodation for their booking. As the result, the place with a lot of good feedbacks can attract more prospective customers and vice versa. Hence, reviews from clients are very important in rental business. In order to run the business well, and attract the large number of customers every year, the hosts need to analyze the customer feedbacks to understand what the problems are with their listings and services, what the customers’ expectation are. Moreover, based on the reviews, Airbnb also plays a role of a supporter to help the hosts know what are expected in the region so that the hosts can improve their listings and services to drive a profitable business. However, the feedback data is human natural language that is form of unstructured data. Data content is not organized, and contains lots of noise such as unnecessary words, emojis, symbols, weird characters, etc. How can businesses exploit, statistic and draw evaluation results that are
negative or positive feedbacks? How can they determine the criteria that need improvement to satisfy most of customers' expectations about their products and services so that they drive their products and business development?

DATA
Data used for this project is derived from “Inside Airbnb” website. In this project, we explore customer review data of all listings in Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal in Canada compiled until Feb-2021.

Data term of use:
“Inside Airbnb” is a dependent, non-commercial set of tools and data that allows
everyone to explore how Airbnb is really being used in cities around the world. The data
behind the Inside Airbnb is sourced from publicly available information from the Airbnb
site”. This site is personally funded by Murray Cox, everyone can donate to contribute for
data collection payment.
This site claimed that data contain no private information, all information are publicly
display on Airbnb website. Moreover, they confirmed that data is “fair use” for noncommercial
purposes and allow public analysis due to community benefit.
